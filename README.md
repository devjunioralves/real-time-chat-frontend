This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

### What would I improve on this project?

##### In this project there is a lot to be improved, I leave here some points that in my opinion are very far from my liking.

- Architecture, the architecture of the project is not to my liking, I see that it is very much directly dependent on using the axios instance for example
- Components, the components are very static, in my opinion the components should be generic so that they can be reused in the future on other pages
- Layout, the layout is responsive but it is not visually pretty at all, it is something to be developed and designed over time
- Service layer, it is important and essential to have a layer to handle event triggering and API requests
